-Check WillInTxt_Demo files for the latest verson of the template to work off of.

-WillGen_v3.py is the current python file to use

-Template.txt is the current testing file and custdata.csv is its corresponding data input file.

More Notes(For Balaji)-
-UIandForms folder is where all the python flask programs are. Some of them may have bugs.

-Testing folder has all my experimental codes

-Downloads folder has test templates that Aina Aunty had sent long ago

-Demo folder was made to show the working will generator using only text files and csv inputs.

ToDo-

-Must implement a 1st column in the .csv file to indicate the data type, to collect the data accordingly.

-Implement the for loop construct in template

-Shift the template from text file to HTML or some other plain text formatable document.
